    "summary": "Hi, my name is Like Zheng. Throughout my 5-year career, I have spent the first 3 years as a software engineer and the latter 2 years primarily working as a product manager, with a decent understanding of UI design. In my spare time, I enjoy writing code and experimenting with new technologies. My expertise leans more towards front-end development as opposed to back-end, and I have a strong focus on user experience, which is why I've taken up learning about product design and UI design. I value teamwork and have successfully built a 6-member front-end team from scratch, fostering an agile culture along the way.",
